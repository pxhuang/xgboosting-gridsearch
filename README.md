The age of abalone in general is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope. Instead of such boring and time-consuming task, the age could be predicted by assessing other measurements, which are easier to obtain. Given is the name, type, and the measurement unit of all 7 attributes. The number of rings is the value to predict (integer).

The Attributes list is given as:
Sex	             (M,F,I)
Length	         continuous
Diameter	       continuous
Height	         continuous
Whole Weight	   continuous
Shucked Weight	 continuous
Viscera Weight	 continuous
Shell Weight	   continuous
